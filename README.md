# Discourse integration into Nextcloud

üó®Ô∏è Discourse integration provides a dashboard widget displaying your important notifications
and the ability to find topics and posts with Nextcloud's unified search.

## üîß Configuration

### User settings

The account configuration happens in the "Connected accounts" user settings section.

A link to the "Connected accounts" user settings section will be displayed in the widget for users who didn't configure a Discourse account.

## üõ†Ô∏è State of maintenance

While there are some things that could be done to further improve this app, the app is currently maintained with **limited effort**. This means:

* The main functionality works for the majority of the use cases
* We will ensure that the app will continue to work like this for future releases and we will fix bugs that we classify as 'critical'
* We will not invest further development resources ourselves in advancing the app with new features
* We do review and enthusiastically welcome community PR's

We would be more than excited if you would like to collaborate with us. We will merge pull requests for new features and fixes. We also would love to welcome co-maintainers.

If you are a customer of Nextcloud and you have a strong business case for any development of this app, we will consider your wishes for our roadmap. Please contact your account manager to talk about the possibilities.
